#
# Notes:
# This script takes the build, cache, and environment directories are arugments.
# Cache is persisted between builds. The full application should be built in the
# build directory. This is a temporary directory that the Heroku built system
# will package into a slug with a different path, so symlinks can cause
# problems.
#
# We circumvent this difficulty by building the deploy jar and copying that to
# the build directory.
